Hangman in Python
Hangman is a word-guessing game implemented in Python 3.10.

To run this code, you will need a file or a list of words. In the code example, I used the file "random-words.txt", but you can replace it with a list of words if you prefer.

The game progresses by revealing the letters of the chosen word based on user input. If the guess is correct, that letter is removed from the remaining characters list. However, if the guess is incorrect, the hangman process begins, and the stages of the hangman drawing are displayed.

Here is an example of the hangman stages:

Stage 1:
![hang1](https://github.com/kazem2022/Hang-Man-in-python/assets/118965194/42b6505c-b327-4aed-8a2d-07fd0cd459f7)

Stage 6:
![hang](https://github.com/kazem2022/Hang-Man-in-python/assets/118965194/8207c3f1-f99d-42f4-8853-6e0f1387214a)

In the game, if the hangman drawing reaches stage 6, the player loses. However, if the player successfully guesses all the letters of the word, they win.
